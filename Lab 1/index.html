        <div class="Introduction">
            Hello! I am from Chicago, Illinois, and I have lived here my entire life. In my free time, I love to bake, and my 
            favorite thing to make is banana bread. Another passion of mine is watching and critiquing movies. My favorite movie 
            franchise is the Harry Potter series. I also love to travel, and my favorite place to visit is Puerto Rico because my family is there.
