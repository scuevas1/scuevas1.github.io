            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Hello! I am from Chicago, Illinois, and I have lived here my entire life. 
                In my free time, I love to bake, and my favorite thing to make is banana bread. 
                Another passion of mine is watching and critiquing movies. My favorite movie 
                franchise is the Harry Potter series.
