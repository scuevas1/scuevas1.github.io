            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Hello! I am from Chicago, Illinois, and I have lived here my entire life. 
                In my free time, I love to bake, and my favorite thing to make is banana bread. 
                Another passion of mine is watching and critiquing movies. My favorite movie 
                franchise is the Harry Potter series. I also love to travel, and my favorite place to visit is 
                Puerto Rico because my family is there. The vibrant culture, amazing food, and breathtaking 
                views make it feel like a second home to me.
            </p>
